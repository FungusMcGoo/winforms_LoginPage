A simple log in form with SQL server connectivity, coded in Visualbasic.

Login form must be connected to a database or localdb, the code and parameters are simple enough to switch out with your own.

The styling of the form is based around a corporate-y feel for a fictional company that I created in a videogame. This ficticious company is what I base a lot of my projects around as it helps give myself real world practise while not developing at work.
